## FUTURE DESIRES & INTERESTS ##

My dream is someday creating my own tech company based on the power of data by appliying models of Artificia Inteligence which I think will have (and it is having)
a key role in the future.

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE ##

### DATA SCIENCE AND STRATEGY CONSULTANT  ###
Currently, I lead a Data Sience Project in one of the largest banks of USA, appliying the necessary machine learning model steps to get the required goals 
and profits. As a contractor in Managemen Solutions, I have been working on several classification models of the bank customers. In addition, I worked on 
the Data Extraction of the customer information and the cretion of the strategies to follow during the 2020-2021 year to face the covid effects. Between the 
tasks I did while working for this company we found:

#### Data Science. Computing a classification variable to categorize the bank’s clients assigning a certain grade.
- Data cleaning, preparation and scaling of the different variables involved.
- Modeling of data through classification algorithms.

#### Data Engineering. Collecting data from the banks database to be applied to the models and strategies.
- Computing queries to get the information of each client variable and create the necessary datasets.

#### Strategy. Studied the strategic decisions to apply to the bank’s client.
- Segmenting the clients and studying their behavior.
- Implementing clients risk minimization strategies. Performing swap analysis to establish new models in production.


In the past years, I have been creating my own Projects and never stop learning with courses and reading everything I found. In the past I worked for a company
called everis an NTT Data Company where I had the opportunity to enroll in three different departments.

### BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE DATA ANALYST ###

This was the latest of my 2019 professional year, working for two clients in Spain. Between the tasks I could carry on:


#### Machine Learning and visualization. Investigated the relationship of different factors that could affect the humidity of a resin in order to improve a 
manufacturing process.

- Data cleaning of datasets provided by the chemical company.
- Visualized the different data points.
- Applied a series of linear regressors to the model to see which features were more important.

#### Developed an ARIMA model to see if the viscosity of the resin changed over time and study its impact on the humidity of the resin. Clustering and exploratory 
data analysis. Studied of an airline data to predict the airline's passenger types based on data provided by the company.
- Prepared and cleaned a dataset that would be used for grouping the type of passenger.
- Use linear regression for inference and KNN for group classification.

### ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ENGINEER ###

#### Bayesian Networks and AI. Developed a model of Bayesian networks to classify company worker’s travel delay request as true or false.
- Create model modules.
- Application of Naïve Bayes for classification.

#### Investigation. Explored the possibility of implementing alternative classification algorithms for the project.

### DIGITAL STRATEGY ###

#### Machine Learning. Used medical information of patients to predict which drugs a person would buy.
- Applied a classification algorithm to obtain which drugs a patient would pay by investigating their medical dataset. 

#### Machine Learning. Prediction of blood demand for Red Cross.
- Data cleaning, visualization and scaling data.
- Quantitative blood prediction based on linear regression.
